## Introduction to Quantum Game Theory

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategies that players take in certain environments (e.g. Prisoner's Dilemma). [Quantum game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_game_theory) is the study of more generalized game theory models that make use of quantum computation. The project implements a framework which can be used to spin up quantum game theory models.
