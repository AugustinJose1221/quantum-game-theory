Unfortunately we both get caught, but not quite red handed, so it isn't such an open-and-shut case for the police. In order to try and get a confession out of both of us, the police separate us into different rooms and give each of us two options:\n",
    "* To remain silent and take our chances - we shall call this strategy '0'\n",
    "* To confess and maybe receive a reduced sentence - we shall call this strategy '1'\n",

    "We are told that if we both remain silent (i.e. end up with the '00' outcome), the police still have enough evidence sentence us both to 1 month in prison. However, if one of us confesses (i.e. the outcome is either '01' or '10') the player who chose the '1' strategy goes free and the other player (who chose the strategy '0') receives a 3 month prison sentence. Finally, if we both confess, (i.e. the outcome is '11') then we each get a 2 month prison sentence. These strategies are represented below in a payoff table."

However, they both would prefer to go together rather than to either concert alone.

Meyer [3] in 1999 but it wasn't until later that year that a formal quantum game theory protocol was invented by Eisert, Wilkens & Lewenstein [4] and hence is called the \"EWL quantization protocol\". Since then there have been many contributions to the field, for which we refer the reader to a [comprehensive review of the field by Khan et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-018-2082-8) But for now, let us start by looking at the EWL quantization protocol."

    "### The EWL Quantization Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as reminder, here is the protocol for a classical 2x2 game:\n",
    "1. Initialization - we start with two '0' bits\n",
    "2. Strategy - each player receives a bit and decides to either keep it as a 0 or flip it to a 1\n",
    "3. Outcome - the outcome is the combination of the two bits\n",
    "4. Payoff - the payoff table is used to find the payoff for each player given the outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that for all 2x2 games, the choice of strategies and the final payoffs are the only things that depend on the game - the the steps to take and the order to take them remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with _quantum_ game theory, we require the EWL quantum protocol to follow two rules: __Rule 1:__ It has to distribute maximally entangled qubits to the players and __Rule 2:__ it has to generalize the classical version of the game. We will first explain the recipe to turn a classical game theory game into a quantum game and then walk through how to implement it in Qiskit. Let's look at how to turn a 2x2 classical game into a quantum game.\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Initialization__ - We start with two $|0\\rangle$ qubits and two classical bits that we will use to store measurement results. Ignoring the classical bits for now, this gives us $$|00\\rangle $$ \n",
    "__2. Entanglement__ - We want the qubits to be maximally entangled to each other by an operator before we hand them off to the players. For now we will call this entangling operator $J$ (and explain it further later on). This gives us the state $$J|00\\rangle $$\n",
    "__3. Strategy__ - Each player is then given a qubit and they each apply a single-qubit unitary operator (or 'strategy') of their choice to their qubit (as opposed to the classical version where they can only choose between keeping it or flipping it). Let's call player 1's strategy $U_1$ and player 2's strategy $U_2$. We then end up with $$U_1U_2J|00\\rangle $$ \n",
    "__4. 'Disentanglement'__- The qubits are then put through a 'disentangling' gate $J^{\\dagger}$ (we will get to why later on). We now have $$J^{\\dagger}U_1U_2J|00\\rangle $$\n",
    "__5. Measurement__ - The qubits are measured in the computational basis and the measurements are stored in the two classical bits <br>\n",

    "__7. Payoff__ - The payoff table is used to find the payoff for each player given the outcome <br>\n",

To answer this question, we have to introduce the notion of mixed (i.e. probabilistic) strategies. \n",

This works for quantum strategies too e.g. \"I choose 'X' with 33% probability, 'H' with 33% probability and 'S' with 33% probability.\"  Already we can start to see that classical games (even when allowing for stochasticity) cannot reproduce quantum games (how do we model the effect of stochastic unitary gates with only classical probabilities?).

Naively one could guess that the $X$ strategy is the dominant one, as it corresponds to the classical dominant strategy of choosing '1'.

    "This result is rather remarkable since it shows that every player has a 1/4 chance of winning despite using only pure strategies! This is unachievable in the classical version of the game even when using mixed strategies. And what is even more intriguing is that in the 3-player version of this game 1) there are no pure strategy Nash equilibria and 2) the players each have a 1/4 chance of winning when in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, which is also true for the Nash equilibrium solution for the classical version of the game. So basically, we can't do any better in the 3-player version of the game by making it quantum, but we _can_ in the 4-player version of the game. Why should this be the case? And in what cases of games can we do better in the quantum version compared to the classical ones? The answer to these questions that no one exactly knows yet... welcome to the wonderful and weird world of quantum game theory!"

    "Although we have showcased the Quantum Game Theory package in this tutorial, the code is still very much in progress and there are a many more improvements that could be made to it. Some ideas include\n",
    "* integrate using mixed strategies into the package (currently the randomization has to be done before inputting the strategies into the Game object)\n",
    "* Implement the use of arbitrary rotation and/or unitary gates as strategies (currently only certain fixed gates can be used as strategies)\n",
    "* Implement the EWL protocol with varying degrees of initial entanglement\n",

    "And of course whatever you think would be an interesting addition to the package! We are always happy to hear new ideas and collaborate so please feel free to reach out to us :)"

    "### 2. Play around with the Quantum Game Theory package and start finding interesting results\n",
    "We have only shown the very basics of quantum game theory, and there is so much left to explore, ranging from different protocols (try using the ['MW' protocol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375960100004412?via%3Dihub) in our package!), to multiplayer and multidecision games, finding applications in optimization problems etc. A good place to start looking for inspiration might be the [review by Khan et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-018-2082-8) on quanutm game theory. We hope that as we add more features to the Quantum Game Theory package that people will be able to use it as tool to study this fascinating field. Play on playas!"
